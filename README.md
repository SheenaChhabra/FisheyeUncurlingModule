A <b>'Fisheye Uncurling Module'</b> to correct the image distortion caused by the Fisheye Lens and to provide an ease of visualization to the user for better surveillance.<br/>

<b>Programming Language:</b> C++<br/> 
<b>Image Processing Library:</b> OpenCV<br/>
<b>IDE Used:</b> Microsoft Visual Studio<br/>

<b>Introduction:</b><br/>
This module was prepared as a part of <a href="http://www.i2vsys.com">the I2V Software</a> which provides intelligent surveillance solutions.

The Fisheye lens is a special type of lens which covers 360 degree view so we can replace 3-4 normal lens cameras with a single fisheye camera to reduce cost and maintainance but this fisheye lens creates distortion in the image which makes it difficult for the user to visualise it for the surveillance.

<b>Brief Description:</b><br/>
The distortion caused by Fisheye lens can be removed by uncurling the input image. Simple uncurling algorithm is used to create different types of perspective views.<br/>
